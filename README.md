# EEG_code
EEG_code is a repository created to collect all the necessary tools to allow the analysis of EEG, ECoG, and other neural data in a research environment.

Since it is useless to reinvent the wheel, EEG_code uses functions from other libraries (open-science is awesome).  Therefore, you may need to download eeglab and chronux.
EEG_code uses data structures that can interface with the functions from eeglab.

I am happy to share my code with you all.
Enjoy!
